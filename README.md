# Advent of Code 2023 :santa:

This repo covers some [Go](https://go.dev/) and [Julia](https://julialang.org/) answers to the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/) problems. A brief summary of each of the statements of each problem is shown below.

1. [Trebuchet?!](#day-1-trebuchet)

## Day 1: Trebuchet?!

The input is a list of strings with letters and numbers. From each string is possible to obtain a number by taking the first and last number and combining it together (using the first one to build the tens and the last one to build the units). The goals of the problem are:
- Part 1: Calculate the sum of all the numbers that can be extracted from each string.
- Part 2: Now spelled numbers ("one", "two", ..., "eight" and "nine) are also treated as numbers and used to construct the number assigned to each string. Calculate the new sum of all the numbers.
